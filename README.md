# CRIC Custom Runtime Image Creator
**CRIC**  is a gui for the [jlink](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/23/docs/specs/man/jlink.html) command.

It produces custom runtime images, kind of Java Runtime Environments.

The driver behind **CRIC** was the need to create cross-target custom runtime images for the non-modular [Mapton application](https://mapton.org/), well it *is* modular, but using the *NetBeans Module System* instead of *Java Platform Module System*.
